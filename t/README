REQUIREMENTS:
============
* uwsgi version >= 2.1.0 in your system path, for example with enabled plugins pty and forkptyrouter:
	(sudo) UWSGI_BIN_NAME=/usr/bin/uwsgi UWSGI_EMBED_PLUGINS=pty,forkptyrouter make

* docker image named psgi001 (configured similar to plugin-docs) but running an uwsgi version >= 2.1.0.
TODO: could add a Dockerfile to automate the image building.

* docker-py (install it with pip)

* pty folder correctly configured on both the host and the container. Specifically:
	/pty/foo folder writable by user on host
	/pty folder writable by www-data on container

You'd be able to run uwsgi both in non-privileged and root mode.
Note: if you want to run in non-privileged mode, your user should be part of the docker group (in order to be able to manage docker without being root).

If you need to change something in the .ini files, remember to change the related "truth" otherwise tests will fail.


TESTING:
===========
Run uwsgi from the plugin directory:
	uwsgi t/emperor.ini
And then, in another shell, run the tests:
	python t/tests.py
